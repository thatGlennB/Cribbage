ABOUT
This project is intended to aid decision-making while playing the card game Cribbage. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage

HOW TO USE
Currently, this is a console application. To use it, you will need to build the program, and then run it in the console window. You should receive prompts to guide you. Card values are entered by typing the rank (A, 2, 3 ... 10, J, Q, K) and the suit (C, S, H, D). For example, the king of hearts would be KH.
